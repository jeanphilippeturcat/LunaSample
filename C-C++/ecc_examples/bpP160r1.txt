#
#This file describes the domain parameters of an EC curve
#
#File contains lines of text. All lines not of the form key=value are ignored.
#All values must be Hexidecimal numbers except m, k, k1, k2 and k3 which are decimal.
#Lines starting with '#' are comments.
#
#Keys recognised for fieldID values are -
#p               - only if the Curve is based on a prime field
#m               - only if the curve is based on a 2^M field
#k1, k2, k3      - these three only if 2^M field
#
#You should have these combinations of fieldID values -
#p          - if Curve is based on a prime field
#m,k1,k2,k3 - if curve is based on 2^M
#
#These are the values common to prime fields and polynomial fields.
#a          - field element A
#b          - field element B
#s          - seed for curve - this one is optional
#x          - field element Xg of the point G
#y          - field element Yg of the point G
#q          - order n of the point G
#h          - (optional) cofactor h
